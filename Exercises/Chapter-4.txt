1. Assign variables city and state to your current city and state of residence. (If residing outside the U.S., substitute the analogous quantities.)
city = "Brooklyn"
state = "New York"


2. Using interpolation, print (using puts) a string consisting of the city and state separated by a comma and as space, as in “Los Angeles, CA”.
puts "#{city}, #{state}"

3. Repeat the previous exercise but with the city and state separated by a tab character.
puts "#{city} v\ #{state}" (Joe's comment: I don't know what the fuck a tab charater is.)


4. What is the result if you replace double quotes with single quotes in the previous exercise?
"\#{city} \\v \#{state}"



1. What is the length of the string “racecar”?
"racecar".length
 => 7


2. Confirm using the reverse method that the string in the previous exercise is the same when its letters are reversed.
"racecar".reverse == "racecar"
 => true


3. Assign the string “racecar” to the variable s. Confirm using the comparison operator == that s and s.reverse are equal.
s = "racecar"
 => "racecar" 
2.2.3 :016 > s == s.reverse
 => true 


4. What is the result of running the code shown in Listing 4.9? How does it change if you reassign the variable s to the string “onomatopoeia”? Hint: Use up-arrow to retrieve and edit previous commands
s = "racecar"
 => "racecar" 
2.2.3 :020 > puts "It's a palindrome!" if s == s.reverse
It's a palindrome!

s = "onomatopoeia"
 => "onomatopoeia" 
2.2.3 :003 > puts "It's a palindrome!" if s == s.reverse
 => nil 


1. By replacing FILL_IN with the appropriate comparison test shown in Listing 4.10, define a method for testing palindromes. Hint: Use the comparison shown in Listing 4.9.
def palindrome_tester(s)
2.2.3 :011?>   if s == s.reverse
2.2.3 :012?>     puts "It's a palindrome!"
2.2.3 :013?>     else
2.2.3 :014 >       puts "It's not a palindrome."
2.2.3 :015?>     end
2.2.3 :016?>   end
 => :palindrome_tester 

2. By running your palindrome tester on “racecar” and “onomatopoeia”, confirm that the first is a palindrome and the second isn’t.
palindrome_tester("racecar")
It's a palindrome!
 => nil 
2.2.3 :018 > palindrome_tester("onomatopoeia")
It's not a palindrome.
 => nil

3. By calling the nil? method on palindrome_tester("racecar"), confirm that its return value is nil (i.e., calling nil? on the result of the method should return true). This is because the code in Listing 4.10 prints its responses instead of returning them.
palindrome_tester("racecar").nil?
It's a palindrome!
 => true
