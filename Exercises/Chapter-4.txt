1. Assign variables city and state to your current city and state of residence. (If residing outside the U.S., substitute the analogous quantities.)
city = "Brooklyn"
state = "New York"


2. Using interpolation, print (using puts) a string consisting of the city and state separated by a comma and as space, as in “Los Angeles, CA”.
puts "#{city}, #{state}"

3. Repeat the previous exercise but with the city and state separated by a tab character.
puts "#{city} v\ #{state}" (Joe's comment: I don't know what the fuck a tab charater is.)


4. What is the result if you replace double quotes with single quotes in the previous exercise?
"\#{city} \\v \#{state}"



1. What is the length of the string “racecar”?
"racecar".length
 => 7


2. Confirm using the reverse method that the string in the previous exercise is the same when its letters are reversed.
"racecar".reverse == "racecar"
 => true


3. Assign the string “racecar” to the variable s. Confirm using the comparison operator == that s and s.reverse are equal.
s = "racecar"
 => "racecar" 
2.2.3 :016 > s == s.reverse
 => true 


4. What is the result of running the code shown in Listing 4.9? How does it change if you reassign the variable s to the string “onomatopoeia”? Hint: Use up-arrow to retrieve and edit previous commands
s = "racecar"
 => "racecar" 
2.2.3 :020 > puts "It's a palindrome!" if s == s.reverse
It's a palindrome!

s = "onomatopoeia"
 => "onomatopoeia" 
2.2.3 :003 > puts "It's a palindrome!" if s == s.reverse
 => nil
