1. Create a new user at the console. What are the userâ€™s remember and activation tokens? What are the corresponding digests?
remember_token: nil
activation_token: nil
remember_digest: nil
activation_digest: "$2a$10$nstKh4hEQF.toYnBzPLb2OAzAq4eW0XVgAUMYXYp3x8..."



2. Using the generalized authenticated? method from Listing 11.26, verify that the user is authenticated according to both the remember token and the activation token.
