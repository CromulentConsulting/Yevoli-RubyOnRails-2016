This is a little experiment on the education of a future software engineer.

# Goal
Yevoli learns Ruby on Rails sufficiently well to work as an entry level software engineer.  

He is motivated and well prepared to continue this education in two directions:

1. Underpinning his tradesman knowledge with the fundamentals of computer science
2. Expanding his skillset into additional programming languages and territories (ie. from RoR web-app to iOS native app development)

# Strategy

Joe will work through a preexisting curriculum at his own pace, dedicating 1 hour / day on 6 days a week.  Dan will provide mentorship async.  At the end of the existing curriculum, Joe will design an independent project that leverages and challenges what he has learned.  Dan will continue to provide mentorship on the design and execution of that project.

# Tactics

## The Code
Joe will work through [railstutorials.org book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) and his independent project with all work and mentorship in git or github:

- Apps should be created in subdirectories (named for the corresponding chapter of the tutorial or independent project)
- Significant non-app work (ie. toy code, reinforcement projects) should also be created in subdirectories
  - Sometimes you need to just fart around in the interpreter; **don't worry about submitting *all* code!**
- Individual units of work (ie. portions of an app, toy code, reinforcement projects) should be performed on branches and submitted using the Pull Request (PR) feature of GitHub.  Dan will code review the PR and use that mechanism for discussion and mentorship.
- Questions that arrise outside of an app, or that are pressing before a full PR is ready, should be submitted as GitHub issues.

## Grades
We're not grading work unless and until the utility of scoring system can be proven.

Code is static.  It will be scrutinized and judged for what it is right then and there.  The author of the code is always changing.  They will be judged on their reactions and growth.

## The Rest
- Get enough sleep.
- Stay physically active, it helps your brain grow.
  - Your brain is going to grow and you will feel growing pains.  This is good!  
- Your mentor can and will help you through anything, so long as you've given it the old college try.
  - Some things will seem silly but will be really hard to figure out or wrap your head around (ie. grok).
  - The *old college try* will not be strictly definined; like porn, I'll know it when I see it.
- Search your brain first.  It's more powerful than google, more creative, and the ads are more relevant.
  - Then try googling.  Learning how to google for an answer is a useful additional skill in and of itself.
